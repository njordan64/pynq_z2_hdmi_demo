PDRC-132#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_A6A5_WARN  
Luts A6LUT and A5LUT in use in site SLICE_X19Y40 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-136#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_C6C5_WARN  
Luts C6LUT and C5LUT in use in site SLICE_X33Y60 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-138#1 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_D6D5_WARN  
Luts D6LUT and D5LUT in use in site SLICE_X33Y60 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-138#2 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_D6D5_WARN  
Luts D6LUT and D5LUT in use in site SLICE_X44Y111 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-138#3 Warning
SLICE_PairEqSame_D6D5_WARN  
Luts D6LUT and D5LUT in use in site SLICE_X48Y92 with different equations without A6 pin connected to Global Logic High.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi_pll/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi_pll/clk_audio_counter[5]_i_3/O, cell simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi_pll/clk_audio_counter[5]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi_pll/clk_audio_counter[5]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 8 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi/true_hdmi_output.packet_picker/audio_clock_regeneration_packet/clk_audio_counter_reg[0],
simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi/true_hdmi_output.packet_picker/audio_clock_regeneration_packet/clk_audio_counter_reg[1],
simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi/true_hdmi_output.packet_picker/audio_clock_regeneration_packet/clk_audio_counter_reg[2],
simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi/true_hdmi_output.packet_picker/audio_clock_regeneration_packet/clk_audio_counter_reg[3],
simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi/true_hdmi_output.packet_picker/audio_clock_regeneration_packet/clk_audio_counter_reg[4],
simple_hdmi_i/hdmi_top_0/inst/hdmi/true_hdmi_output.packet_picker/audio_clock_regeneration_packet/clk_audio_counter_reg[5],

REQP-165#1 Advisory
writefirst  
Synchronous clocking is detected for BRAM (simple_hdmi_i/axi_vdma_0/U0/I_PRMRY_DATAMOVER/GEN_MM2S_FULL.I_MM2S_FULL_WRAPPER/GEN_INCLUDE_MM2S_SF.I_RD_SF/I_DATA_FIFO/BLK_MEM.I_SYNC_FIFOGEN_FIFO/xpm_fifo_instance.xpm_fifo_sync_inst/xpm_fifo_base_inst/gen_sdpram.xpm_memory_base_inst/gen_wr_a.gen_word_narrow.mem_reg_1) in SDP mode with WRITE_FIRST write-mode. This is the preferred mode for best power characteristics, however it may exhibit address collisions if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted read data. It is suggested to confirm via simulation that an address collision never occurs and if so it is suggested to try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
